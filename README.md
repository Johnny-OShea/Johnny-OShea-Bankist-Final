## Introduction
Hey there, I'm Johnny O'Shea, a computer science student at NC State. In an ever expanding quest to learn as much as possible about 
coding and computer software I turned my attention towards the popular langauge, JavaScript. The Bankist program is an introduction 
javaScript program that displays the banking information of a user in their desired format in a minimalistic view. This program
incorporates concepts related to arrays, objects, and date/time functions. Through it users can send money to other users, request
a loan, and even terminate an account. This is all done on a smooth user interface that interacts intuitively with the user.
